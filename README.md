A continued/functional version of the Peter SZTANOJEV 'Viewporter' World of Warcraft (WoW) addon hosted on curseforge.
Original author: Peter SZTANOJEV <sztanpet@gmail.com>

This addon is updated to work with the 9.0 version of World of Warcraft (Shadowlands).

I am passively maintaining this addon, to get rid of errors and issues, when a new patch is released.
I am not actively testing on PTR, so any patches that breaks features, won't be added until later.

This include a fix for the mid-fight cinematic resizing issues.
The Cinematics doesn't scale correctly, but mid-combat cinematics no longer reset the viewport size.
